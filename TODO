o Remove structs "command" and "state", we don't need objects
for them, just put them in a big old switch statement, one for each.

* Rethink GOB_ANIM_... scheme?
Right now, state contains a GOB_ANIM_ index,
which refers to the master list, instead of
an animation relative to each sprite.

* maybe some documentation would be nice, maybe

* maybe instead of passing functions, which sucks, my god
does it suck, there should just be a big switch statement.
